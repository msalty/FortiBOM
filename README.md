## Overview

FortiBOM is a client-side web application that helps Sales Engineers build and export structured Bill of Materials quotes for Fortinet network security deployments. Select from 13+ supported products, configure hardware models, support tiers, and licenses, then combine everything into a single exportable project BOM — no backend server or external dependencies required.

## Features

- **Multi-product hub** — 13+ Fortinet products organized by category in a sidebar navigation
- **Per-product configuration** — choose hardware model, quantity, FortiCare support tier, and add-on licenses for each product
- **Project BOM aggregation** — combine multiple product configurations into one quote with shared customer metadata (name, opportunity ID, SE name, date, project scope)
- **Global license term selection** — apply co-term, 1-year, 3-year, or 5-year terms to all SKUs at export time
- **Export options** — download as CSV, TSV, or use the print-optimized view for customer-ready output
- **Import & iterate** — re-import a previously exported CSV to continue editing a quote
- **Drag-to-reorder** — reorder product groups and line items within a project
- **Custom section headers** — insert labels (e.g., "Core Firewall", "Option A – SD-WAN") to organize complex quotes
- **Session persistence** — browser `localStorage` saves cart state across page refreshes

## Getting Started

**Requirements:** Any modern web browser. No installation, build step, or internet connection needed.

**Running locally:**

```bash
# Option 1 — open directly in browser
open index.html

# Option 2 — serve with any static file server
npx serve .
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

**Basic workflow:**

1. Select a product from the sidebar
2. Configure the hardware model, quantity, support tier, and any add-on licenses
3. Click **Add to Project BOM**
4. Repeat for each product in the quote
5. Fill in project metadata (customer name, opportunity ID, etc.)
6. Select the license term and export as CSV or print

## Architecture

FortiBOM is intentionally dependency-free — everything runs in the browser with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

```
FortiBOM/
├── index.html          # Main hub shell and project BOM cart
└── products/           # Self-contained per-product BOM generators
    ├── fortigate-bomgen.html
    ├── fortiswitch-bomgen.html
    └── ...
```

- **`index.html`** hosts the sidebar, project metadata form, and BOM cart
- **`products/*.html`** are embedded as iframes; each is a standalone configurator
- **PostMessage API** carries BOM data from product iframes to the parent hub
- **SKU convention** — all internal SKUs use a `-DD` suffix; the parent substitutes the correct term (`-12`, `-36`, `-60`) on export
